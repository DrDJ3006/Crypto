# Cryptographic Algorithms Implementation

This repository hosts implementations of two major cryptographic standards: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman). These modules are designed for educational purposes to help users understand the fundamentals of cryptographic algorithms.

## Repository Structure

- `AES/`: Contains the implementation of the AES encryption algorithm, supporting various key sizes and modes.
  - [AES README](AES/readme.md)
- `RSA/`: Houses the RSA encryption algorithm implementation, suitable for learning about key generation, encryption, decryption, and digital signatures.
  - [RSA README](RSA/README.md)

## Getting Started

Clone this repository using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DrDJ3006/Crypto.git
```
Navigate to each directory to learn more about the specific implementation and usage instructions.
